Assignment - 1
A good program must be time efficient and memory efficient. Performance of a program can be improved by optimizing the code. Optimizing can be done at design level and source code level	

Identify different ways to solve a problem and choose the best algorithm
1.	Finding a prime number 
2.	To find whether a  number is Armstrong number  
3.	To find  palindrome words in a given string
4.	To remove all the duplicate  elements in an integer array

Assignment – 2
Conduct the Loop Optimisation for the following  source code  to improve the program’s performance.
1.
for (i=1; i<count; i++) { 
	a[i] = i*j*k*l*m*n; 
} 

2.
for (discount = 0; discount < numD; discount++) 
{ 
 for (rate = 0; rate < numR; rate++) 
 { 
     rateTbl[rate] = rateTbl[rate] * discountTbl[discount]; 
 } 
} 

3.
for (i=1; i<count; i++) { 
   a[i] = Math.pow(log(i) / log(3), 2); 
} 

Assignment-3

1. What is the result that will be printed out ?
public class Test{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
 float f=(1/4) *10;
int i = Math.round(f);
System.out.println(i);
}}
Output -> 0

2.
Which of the following are valid declarations?
1. int i = 0XCAFE; Yes (Hex number)
2. boolean b = 0; No
3. char c = 'A'; Yes
4. byte b = 128; No
5. char c = ""A""; No

3. 
class Test{
 public static void main(String [] args){
 int x= 2;
 int y= 1;
 for (int z = 0; z < 5; z++){
  if (( ++x > 2 ) || (++y > 2)){
   x++;
 }}
 System.out.println(x + "" "" + y);
 }
}
What is the output of the program?
Output -> 12 1
